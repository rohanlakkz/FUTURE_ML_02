# FUTURE_ML_02 2️⃣
This is my 2nd task of my internship (Future Interns) where I built a Support Ticket Classification and Priority Prediction System using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Google Colab using Python.

🟡 In this project, I worked with real customer support ticket data and built a Machine Learning model that can automatically:
1.Classify support tickets into categories
2.Predict ticket priority levels
3.Help businesses handle support requests faster
4.Project Work Included

🧑‍💻 In this project I have done:
1.Data loading and cleaning
2.Removing missing values
3.Text preprocessing and cleaning
4.Converting text into numerical format
5.Feature extraction using TF-IDF
6.Training Machine Learning models
7.Category prediction of support tickets
8.Priority prediction of support tickets
9.Model evaluation using accuracy and classification metrics

⚙️ How the System Works
The system reads the ticket description written by customers and automatically predicts:

🎟️Ticket Category
Examples:
Technical Issue
Billing Inquiry
Product Inquiry
Cancellation Request

🎫Ticket Priority
Examples:
High
Medium
Low
The ticket text is cleaned and processed, then converted into numerical values using TF-IDF Vectorization, and Machine Learning models are used to predict category and priority.

⚔️Tools and Technologies Used
Python
Google Colab
Pandas
NLTK
Scikit-learn
TF-IDF Vectorizer

📊Logistic Regression
Dataset

📈 Dataset used for this project is a Customer Support Ticket Dataset from Kaggle.
Dataset includes:
Ticket Description
Ticket Type
Ticket Priority
Customer Information
The dataset was downloaded in CSV format and used for training Machine Learning models.
Project Output

The system can take a new support ticket and automatically predict:
Example:
Input Ticket:"My payment was deducted but order not confirmed"
Output:Category → Billing Inquiry
Priority → High

👾Conclusion
This project shows how Machine Learning can help automate customer support systems by automatically categorizing and prioritizing support tickets.
This helps businesses:
Reduce manual work
Respond faster to customers
Identify urgent problems quickly
Improve customer support efficiency
